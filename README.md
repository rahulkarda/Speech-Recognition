[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

[Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.). SpeechRecognition interface, which provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input (normally via the device's default speech recognition service) and respond appropriately.

## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Adding support for more languages  
   2. Solving Browser compatibility issues
              
## Lessons Learned
My learning was focused on making the use of Web Speech API and to create a simple UI where user can select a language and start Speech Recognition to convert the speech to text. Learned how the Web Speech API works and differnece between SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.).
